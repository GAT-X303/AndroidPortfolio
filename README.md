# AndroidPortfolio

To design an Android application and apply my skills of basic Android development that would contain similar information to my portfolio site. The application was intended to run on the Nexus 6P(xxhdpi). 

# Disclaimer

I did borrow some code and use some resources from other sites, those sites have been sourced in the code.
